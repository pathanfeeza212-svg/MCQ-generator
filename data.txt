Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) refers to a class of AI systems that can create new content
such as text, images, audio, code, and videos by learning patterns from existing data. These models are
trained on large datasets and use techniques like deep learning, neural networks, and transformers to generate human-like outputs. Generative AI is widely used in applications such as chatbots, content creation, image synthesis, music composition, and software development. Popular generative models include large language models, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. While Generative AI improves productivity and creativity, it also raises ethical concerns related to data privacy, bias, misinformation, and responsible use, making regulation and transparency important aspects of its development.
